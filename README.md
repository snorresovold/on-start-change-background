# on-start-change-background

<p>My friends always like to change my bacground when i leave my client</p>

<p>therefore I made this script that chooses a random image from the backgrounds folder and makes it the background</p>

<p>to run this on startup make sure to have this in the startup folder if you want it to run on startup</p>
